Overall percentage of missing values

```{r}

```

Missing values per variable

```{r}

-   p6 - Size of locality: has the highest missing data on average (96%) almost most are not answering this question. This might not be highly relevant to the analysis

-   p13 - Language of interview: has the second highest amount of missing data (94%). This question may be helpful for the analysis.

-   p7 - Region: high amount of missing data (94%). We might be able to fill in this question from other questions such as postal code.

-   qc3 - Thinking about the most recent time when you felt discriminated against, under what circumstances did it take place?: high amount of missing data (84%) and highly important for the purpose of the analysis

-   d40 - Could you tell me how many people aged 15 years or more live in your household, yourself included?: high amount of missing data (78%) might not be very relevant for analysis

-   qa3 - Why do you think you are not benefitting from international trade? (M): moderate amount of missing data (67%). The question might not be relevant to the analysis.

-   qa15 - From which of the following countries outside of the EU have you bought goods or services? moderate amount of missing data (62%) but might not be relevant to the analysis

-   d15 (specifically d15 b) - Did you do any paid work in the past? What was your last occupation?: moderate missing data (52%) but could be relevant for the analysis

-   qa2 - Why do you think you are benefitting from international trade? (M): low to moderate missing data (37%). The question is also highly correlated to qa3.

-   qb8 - Did the EU energy label have an influence on the choice of your purchase of electric appliances (fridges, washing machines, dish washers, televisionsâ€¦)?: low amount of missing data (8%)

-   qa5 (specifically b) - Following up qa5a Which of the following statements best describes your opinion about globalisation? Firstly?: low amount of missing data (7%)

-   qa18 (specifically b) - Following up qa18a Where do you get most of your information on globalisation and international trade? Firstly: low amount of missing data (5%)

-   qa4 (specifically b) - Following up qa4a In your opinion, what should be the main priorities of the European Union's trade policy for the years to come? Firstly? (M): low amount of missing data (3%)

# Imputation

## Multiple Imputation with ML

```{r}
df <- data %>% 
  select(!(starts_with("p6")|starts_with("p13")|starts_with("p7")|starts_with("d40")|starts_with("qa3")|starts_with("qa2")))

var <- sapply(df, var) %>% 
  as.list() %>% 
  .[!(is.na(.))] %>% 
  .[. != 0] %>% 
  names()

cat <- df %>% 
  select(!where(is.numeric)) %>% 
  select(!c("doi", "version")) %>% 
  colnames()

df <- df %>% 
  select(all_of(c(var,cat)))
```

```{r warning = FALSE}
m <- 5

df_pmm <- complete(mice(df, m = m, method='pmm'), action=m)
df_rf <- complete(mice(df, m = m, method='rf'), action=m)
df_cart <- complete(mice(df, m = m, method='cart'), action=m)
df_logReg <- complete(mice(df, m = m, method='logreg'), action=m)
```

```{r}
write_rds(df_pmm, "df_pmm.rds")
write_rds(df_rf, "df_rf.rds")
write_rds(df_cart, "df_cart.rds")
write_rds(df_logReg, "df_logReg.rds")
```
